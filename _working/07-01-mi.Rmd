# Week 7: MI and Count Models

This week, we discuss two topics:

1. Multiple imputation to deal with missing values.
1. Models of count data.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Multiple Imputation

```{r}
# krup <- haven::read_dta("data/krup.dta") %>%
#   filter(dummy2000 == 1) %>% 
#   select(income, education, age, PIDStrength, black, turnout, married, interest, Church) %>%
#   mutate(income = round(income*4),
#          education = round(education*4),
#          Church = round(Church*3),
#          PIDStrength = round(PIDStrength*3)) %>% # amelia wants ordinal variables to be integers
#   #na.omit() %>%
#   glimpse()
# 
# skimr::skim(krup)
# 
# library(Amelia)
# amelia(krup, noms = c("black", "turnout", "married"),
#             ords = c("income", "education", "PIDStrength", "interest", "Church"),
#        m = 20)
# 
# plot(mi)
